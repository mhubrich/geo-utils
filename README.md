# Geo Utils
A number of geospatial utility functions I frequently use in Python, for example:
- Loading and saving GeoJSON files
- Shifting points by given distance and angle
- Translating geometries by given offsets
- Splitting geometries by given geometry
- Computing distance between points
- Computing length of a linestring
- Returning a substring with specific length of a linestring
- Determine which side of a line a given point falls on
- Creating a circle from a given point and radius
- Converting multi-geometries to single-geometries
- Removing holes in polygons
- Removing tiny geometries (artifacts)
- Simplifying geometries (reduces amount of nodes)
- Compressing geometries (reduces amount of floating point digits of nodes)
